# ðŸ§  Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Generation

An **advanced agentic AI research assistant** that revolutionizes research workflows through intelligent automation and sophisticated tool orchestration. This cutting-edge system leverages a LangGraph-powered state machine architecture to autonomously select, chain, and execute specialized tools, transforming complex research tasks into streamlined, efficient processes without requiring manual intervention.

Built on a foundation of modular design principles, the Dynamic Research Assistant integrates multiple AI providers, advanced web search capabilities, intelligent document processing, real-time fact verification, and comprehensive data extraction tools. The system features persistent conversation memory, sophisticated citation management, and a dual-interface architecture that supports both programmatic API access and interactive web-based usage.

The platform's agent-driven architecture automatically analyzes incoming queries, determines the optimal tool selection strategy, and executes multi-step research workflows that combine web search, content extraction, summarization, fact-checking, data mining, and citation generation. This autonomous approach eliminates the need for users to manually configure pipelines or understand the underlying complexity, instead providing a seamless research experience that adapts to diverse query types and complexity levels.

## ðŸš€ Features
